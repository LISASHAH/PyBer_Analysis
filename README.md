# PyBer_Analysis
<BR>Summarizes data displayed in the DataFrame
<BR>Dataframe displays the number of rides and number of drivers for each area. Urban cities have much more use of PyBer Rides over the Rural area. People in rural area spend average of around 10$ more then urban area. Over all the earning per driver is way less in urban, decent in suburban and highest in rural. This is due to number of drivers available there. There is a high possibililty that due to lack of drivers in Rural area, the wait time for the ride is very high and hence people do not use these rides

<BR>Explains the implication of the data summarized in the DataFrame and the Multiple-line chart
<BR>The dataframe clearly shows that the number of drivers differs in various areas and it directly impacts the number of rides and total fares in each area. The summary total does not talk about the total per month showing any seasonality.
<BR>Where as the the graph show the total rides per month for each area. This shows the seasonality. But it does not convey to us how many rides were done and how many drivers did each area have.
